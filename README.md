# UNHPRoboticsProgrammingRepository

## Intro

This is the Offical UNHP Robotics Programming Repository where we dump all our code into to allow for easier file sharing. This account & repository will (hopefully) be maintained by the programming council & be used as a way to version manage files.

## Naming Convention Rules

### **BEST(year of competition)_(file version)**

For example, if I was uploading the 5th version of the 2020 file, the name would be "BEST2020_5"
