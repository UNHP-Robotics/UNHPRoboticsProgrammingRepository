# UNHPRoboticsProgrammingRepository

##Intro

This is the Offical UNHP Robotics Programming Repository where we dump all our code into to allow for easier file sharing. This account & repository will (hopefully) be maintained by the programming council & be used as a way to version manage files.

##Naming Convention Rules

###**BEST(year of competition)_(file version)**

For example, if I was uploading the 5th version of the 2020 file, the name would be "BEST2020_5"

##Other notes

This only for uploading & downloading files. You can't really view/edit ROBOTC files and I don't think anyone cares enough to make an interpreter for github. Please make seperate folders for different years. Council members can change this repository as they see fit.
